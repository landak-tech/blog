   By utilizing data analytics we can develop as many curricula as many students there is, it is possible to make the curriculum suited to every student's personality. Even if you're running in limited resources, data analytics could help to optimize both curricula, students, and resources by clustering and optimizing it to the best possible scenario.
3. **Adaptive Learning**  
   As mentioned above, data analytics not only possible to develop adaptive content but also possible to offer learner support, e.g. offer them other opportunities of engagement.
