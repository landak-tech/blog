An asset-intensive industry is an industry that requires an above-average level of their capital expenditure to be spent on their operational-physical-asset, their financial performance highly depends on their asset performance. Their performance evaluation, short term planning, long term planning has to take into account the complex asset system, the vast amount of equipment, and their embedded risk.

Ironically, even though most of the asset management and maintenance concepts were developed in the '70s and '80s e.g. reliability-centered maintenance, a study shows in the early '2000s, only 30% of the US asset-intensive organization do proper maintenance planning. This could be worse if it was measure at a higher level of planning, such as asset management planning or even strategic asset management planning. It could be even worse if it was measure in other countries which has less strict regulation regarding to the asset management. This was due to the very basic problem, which is the documented information related to the asset.

Before an asset-intensive organization wishes to embark on a data analytics journey, they have to assess their maturity of documented information, which is required in the latest management system standard of ISO 55001-2014 Asset Management System,  Clause 7 Information Requirement. Once they are sure that their maturity level is aligned with the data analytics purposes, they can begin the analytical procedures. This way, before they even began the resources-consuming analytical-process, they can improve and develop their data integrity and minimize the risk of failure of the analytical project.

Data analytics methods could help asset-intensive organizations to overcome their analytical & planning problem. Moreover with the booming of digital transformation in the last decade, makes data and computation infrastructure becomes more available and affordable to perform such task.

## The Use Cases

Data analytics could be implemented by an asset-intensive organization in the subject, but not limited to, such as:
1. Asset Failure Prediction.
2. Remaining Life Assessment.
3. Asset Performance Analysis.
4. Inventory Management Strategies.
5. Asset Whole-Lifecycle Costing Analysis + Monte Carlo Analysis.
<br>

Eventually, to optimize their performance during the operational phase, asset-intensive organizations have to improve and strengthen their core function, which is maintenance planning and execution. It is said that the best performing organization is the one that does their basic stuff at an exceptional level. Once it is mature, data analytics methods could be employed to improve organization performance even further.
